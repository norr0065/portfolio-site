            <h2 class="milli capitalize ">Application Design</h2>
                <p class="micro">I have created an app designed for a portable low cost tablet that would directly help women who are undertaking an entrepreneurial endeavor through the means of micro finance and group lending. Aiding female entrepreneurs in rural communities become the drivers of economic productivity and opportunity. Targeting women who want to start their own, or have a business, that fuels self sufficiency and empowerment.</p>
               
                    <p class="micro">Many programs today offer micro-loans, education and training to learn business as well as life skills when undertaking a self sufficient business. The job training provided leads to income generation but whats most important is making sure the business is sustainable to ensure lasting economic wellbeing and power for these women.</p>
                    
                <p class="micro">This APP would act as a digital personal savings book - that would keep track of their savings and help keep them on track with back payment. The app would show which members are contributing and how they are helping as well as who has borrowed and how they are doing paying back their loan.Â This app would be a device that would stick around after the training has been provided, acting as a liaison between Non profit organizations who have loaned funds to the female entrepreneurs and where the money is being spent to influence more growth.</p>
                    
                  <p class="micro">By using this app they will be able to better track spending and saving mean while establishing their business, expanding their business, furthering their educations all the while providing support for their families.</p>
