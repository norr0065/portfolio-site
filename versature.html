                <p class="micro">Designed alongside the team at Ottawa's Machine Agency, I lead the redesign of Versature's website. Versature is a customer-centric organization dedicated to providing the highest quality cloud-based business phone solutions to Canadian customers. In creating a functional yet captivating website for Versature, we wanted to keep what they did well with their previous look and combine it with what they do best now - provide the best businees solution when it comes to communication. Versature is recognized for business excellence, they needed a website that illustrated that they are an innovative leader in the Canadian Telecommunications industry.
