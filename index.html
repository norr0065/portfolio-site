       I am a web & graphic designer based in Ottawa with over 3 years of freelance and studio experience. Design and art have been in my life since I was only a twinkle in my mothers eye. I love anything related to pixels, graphics, and design. Now in my final year of my advanced diploma in Graphic Design, I have learned that I have a true passion for designing detailed, creative, and modern pieces. I am ready and excited to see where my future in design takes me.
