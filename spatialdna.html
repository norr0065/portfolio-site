Spatial DNA provides strategic insight and perspective to the integration of spatial data and technology into corporate information systems. Spatial data is a strategic component for the enterprise, and with this insight this company is able to develop an open architecture that supports business needs now and into the future.</p>
        
        
<p class="micro">With expansion into new markets, Spatial DNA outgrew its current branding, and wanted their brand to reflect essence of tecnological driven business. They wanted the message to translate effectively to potential customers. With this change in corporate branding and logo redesign, Spatial DNA completely updated their corporate identity. Tying in familial elements associated with the brand, Spatial DNA was able to create a brand that stands for change, development and  growth.</p>
