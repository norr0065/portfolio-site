        I am an web & graphic designer based in Ottawa with over 3 years of freelance and studio experience. Design and Art have been in my life since I was a twinkle in my mothers eye. 

        I have always loved anything related with pixels, graphics and design. Now, in my final year of my advanced diploma in Graphic Design I have learned that I have a passion for designing detailed, creative and modern designs. I am ready and excited to see where my future in design takes me.
